This is the official website for The Sandwich Man thesandwichmanventura.com

I used Verti by HTML5 UP as a base and took some components I built for my personal website, like the accordian expander on the menus.

The photos I edited are done using gimp, as was the logo that I edited.

Full CI/CD process is code (master branch) -> Github -> Hostinger (git plugin) for hosting.

Domain is through Google Domains
